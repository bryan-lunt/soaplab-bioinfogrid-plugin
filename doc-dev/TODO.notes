* how to configure edrlog.log?

* where is error.txt from? stderr? :
  [ org_glite_wmsui_apij_Api.cpp Warning: edg_wll_LogTransferSTART failed ]

* proper destroying jobs

* explore WMProxy client/library

* not solved: 'executable' with its full path in the "Executable" JDL
directive; do we need it?

* cancelling a job from a different treminal... (must be solved in Soaplab2)
