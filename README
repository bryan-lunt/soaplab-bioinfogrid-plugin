This is a project allowing Soaplab2 to access GRID (using glite/globus
infrastructure). The project was developed for BioinfoGRID European
project (http://www.bioinfogrid.eu), but it is general. It allows all
Soaplab2 clients (e.g. Taverna - http://taverna.sf.net) access GRID
using the same Soaplab2 API.

Adding new applications, running in GRID, requires, however, some
scripting - which is not part of this plugin, but it is, hopefully,
documented in the 'docs' directory.
