ExploreGrid
===========
   build/run/run-any-client org.soaplab.admin.ExploreGrid [options]

where <options> are:

  -h[elp]  ... print this help
  -q       ... "quiet" (less verbose mode)

For exploring GRID:
-------------------
  -job <grid-job-id>  [-vv]
           ... print status of the given job
               (vv ... very verbose)

For exploring a service (without going to any GRID):
----------------------------------------------------
  -name <service-name>

     This is a mandatory option: a service name whose features are
     going to be explored. For example: -name grid.gtesting1

  Exploring metadata is the same as in CmdLineClient. It is included
  here for convenience because to know names of input/output data may
  be handy:

  -i  ... show names of service inputs
  -ii ... show names and attributes of service inputs

  The remaining options are input data (values for parameters that
  will constitued the analysis command-line). The names can be found
  using option -i. The recognized formats are:

  <input-name> <input-value>
  <input-name> :<input-value>
     a value starting with ':' is treated as a file name
     and the contents of this file is used as an input
  -<input-name>
     can be used for boolean parameters and it means
     the same as:
       <input-name> true

  Show JDL that would be cretated and sent to the GRID (it
  incorporates the input data given as described above):

  [-jdl] [-tjdl <file-name>] [-ojdl <file-name>]

  -jdl
        ... create JDL for the given service and show it on the screen
  -tjdl <template-file-name>
        ... create JDL from the given JDL template
            (default is taken either from configuration, selected by
             the service name, or a 'universal.jdl' template is used)
  -ojdl <file-name>
        ... where to write created JDL file
            (default is standard output)
